# The OpenPSA Model Exchange Format Schemas

The https://github.com/open-psa/schemas repository contains the validation schema for the MEF.
The current schema is maintained in RelaxNG_ *Compact* form.
Schemas in other formats are generated automatically for major releases.

`trang_` is used to convert the source schema into RelaxNG and XSD formats.
